### Introduction
This repo is for my website, and hosting it too! 

Since 2015, I've been developing and maintaining this website as a front for my online presence. 
The main purpose of the site is to show viewers who I am, my work and places on the internet where I can be found. 

Over the years, the design and priorities of the site have changed. From originally being a portfolio, to becoming a glorified contact page, the site is flexible based on the design and priorities I'm undertaking at the time. 

### 2018 

Now in 2018, the site prioritizes my journey and my skills. I want people who are interested enough to go to my website to know who I am and what I can do for them, while also being open to them via social media and meeting up in person.
